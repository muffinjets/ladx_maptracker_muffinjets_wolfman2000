Hey!

I accidentally deleted my last README, but it was about time I made it less presumtious lmao

This is mostly depreciated at this point, but anyone's welcome to use these files as they wish

Functionally as of 3.0.0 it's mainly just for entrance randomizer, but everything else is simply commented out, it's not terribly hard to re-impliment it on the end user's side.
